## What is News Gateway and why do I care?

News Gateway is a mobile app and news aggregator developed for the Android Operating System.
The app works by pulling in news stories from the web through [News API](http://newsapi.org/) that provides news in 
the JSON format which is pulled in the standard News Gatway Format. Stories are opened in default browser. Stories are updated real-time,
and you'll always find the latest stories when you either refresh or open the app. 

So here comes the ‚ÄúNews Gateway‚Äù üéâ.

* Top Headlines
* 50+ News Sources across 7 categories
* 5000+ Stories
* Latest News on refresh
* In-app story sharing 
* Material Design.
* Blazingly fast and lightweight.
* No Ads, No Pop-ups.
* Real-time Stories.
